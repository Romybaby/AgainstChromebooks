    <h1> Problems w/ Chromebook Hardware </h1>

    <p> Problem 1: Weak Storage </p>
    <p> Chromebooks typically have 32 gigabytes of local storage.  Google encourages chromebook users to store their data in the cloud instead.  If chromebook users did want to store their data locally, they would be much more limited. </p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <p> Problem 2: Weak CPUs </p>
    <p> Most chromebooks run on older CPUs like the Intel Celeron, Pentium, or Core m3. These CPUs are very low-power and slow.  Chrome OS doesn't require much processing power to begin with, but when you're trying to run certain applications you'll notice a lack of speed.</p>

    <p> Problem 3: Breaks Easily </p>
    <p> HP chromebooks break quite easily, at least from personal experience. A while ago my chromebook fell off my desk at school, and now the screen glitches out constantly.  Students can also disassemble them with ease, making them a distraction if they do it during classtime.
