    <h1>
      Against Chromebooks - Restricting Freedom, Limiting Creativity
    </h1>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      I am not sure anybody who has been given a Chromebook for a high school has enjoyed their time with the device.
      I just got to say to, anybody who is perfectly content with these damned devices is of either a clueless or slavish nature, neither of these are states one should wish to be in.
      This is for a multitude of reasons, if you wish to see all of our reasons you can take a look at the list conveniently provided on the website, but the one we shall focus on this page is the restriction of freedom, more specifically not allow linux support.
      For those who don't know Chrome OS, the operating system which Chromebooks run, is essentially a "googlified" Linux distribution.
      That means Google has basically just added their browser on top of the core components of Linux, which are publicly available for anyone who wishes.
      Also, a Linux distribution is just a variant of Linux.
      For the ones who are not aware of Linux, I don't wish to interject or anything but some call it GNU/Linux, it is basically like Windows, except different in every single way, and it can be installed on you computer.
      Now I mention this because the school has blocked all access to take advantage of the fact that Chrome OS has been blocked on the computer.
      That means no developer mode and no crostini.
      The consequences of not enabling developer mode means no terminal, no chroots, no native linux software, and most infuriating no root access.
      It's insane to me that you can buy a device that you supposedly "own", but don't have the choice to do what you wish with the device.
      There is also many privacy concerns with using a Chromebook, but that is not for this page; I'll restrict myself for now.
      If all that went over your head, I'm not going to bother to explain, just do a Google search.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that is physical consequences, this will more be going over the more philosophical arguments as this is unethical.
      Now I ask you a question like this: "why should a school that celebrates giving more freedom to the student restrict the students Chromebooks to the point that even inspect is block".
      Now even a, blockhead, see what I did there, could see the hypocrisy of that.
      Also, this school trusts the students so much that they even lock the doors to the terrace; if you wish to access the area it requires a teacher to unlock the door.
      But I digress, I could complain for hours, let's see why they should reevaluate their position on Chromebooks.
      Maybe even our filthy admin will see this page, if so, hi admin.
      I will give three reasons for opposing the restrictions put on the Chromebooks, then give the counter-arguments that some people may give.
      The reasons which I shall argue for is that it limits creativity, shows a blatant lack of trust between students and administrators, and lastly encourages idleness. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now on the fact that forcing Chromebooks on us limits our creativity, this will crossover a little into the fifth reason but I will give it it's own paragraph none the less.
      You see there are lots of students that have found a hobby by engaging with their computer, some because of interests in gaming, some wish for creating a website they can call their own, but mostly for the reason that we interact with these devices everyday, and their complex beasts, and its inevitable in a way that people would like to become deeply acquainted with their computers.
      Beyond just computer science if students had access to Linux they could make use of entire office suits, i.e. libre office, image/graphic creation software, i.e. gimp, and ebook readers, i.e. calibre.
      Now if you don't consider these worthwhile pursuits, I'd recommend you go reproach your parents for raising you very wrong.
      Even some of these would have been very useful for class, but we were forced to use merely a website.
      Like I remember in English we were reading an ebook online that was in the *.epub format, now good luck finding a decent website to read that because Chrome doesn't support it out of the box.
      We were forced to be content with a website that covered half the left side of the page in ads.
      What a waste!
    </p>
    <p>
      This community is supposedly based on trust and all that crap, but I mean how can they even say that with a straight face when they hand us these devices.
      Oh wait, that's not hard, it's because people are dumb, now if that sounds entitled it includes me too.
      Most people don't know that you can even install a Linux desktop on your Chromebook, even less those who understand the full capabilities of a computer.
      Now I believe that we should teach the teachers the basics on using Linux, then spend a few days in advisory teaching them what they've learned, most wouldn't pay attention, or even care, but there are a few who would take interest and take better advantage of the Chromebook the school has given them.
      Now somebody may ask something like this: "Wouldn't people just install games on their Chromebook, so therefore it's a better idea to just?"
      First off that doesn't stop people from playing games the internet is too vast and you can't block every game on the internet.
      Also, in general if you restrict people from doing some activity the first thing they are going to do is do exactly that when those restrictions are lifted.
      This extends to everyone from filthy school administrators to parents, you need to teach your students to practice moderation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fact that it encourages idleness, we're not talking about idleness in general but idleness towards learning how to use a computer, a vital skill in a world increasingly dominated by computers.
      What are we teaching our kids to do with computers?
      The answer is we're teaching them a web browser, I bet most people don't even know what a web browser is.
      This will not help them if they go into the workplace and don't understand how to manipulate files or install applications.
      Now these may seem easy and basic to you, but it blows me away how clueless some people are.
      It's also less that kids are not learning what they should when when doing tasks with their computer but about the principles that the school is flying in the face of.
